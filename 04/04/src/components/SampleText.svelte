<p>Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way. I’m sure your mind is roamin’. I’m sure your heart is not with me. But
	with the country to where you’re goin’.</p>
<p>Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune. Bird fly high by the light of the moon. Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.</p>
<p>I’m walkin’ down that long, lonesome road, babe. Where I’m bound, I can’t tell. But goodbye’s too good a word, gal.
	So I’ll just say fare thee well. I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind. You could have done better but I don’t mind.
	You just kinda wasted my precious time. But don’t think twice, it’s all right.</p>
